# Used Car Sales From eBay Kleinanzeigen

In this project, a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classified section of the German eBay website will be explored, cleaned and analysed.

Although the dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. A few modifications from the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle was made by Dataquest. Modifications made include:
* A sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure code runs quickly in the hosted environment
* The dataset was dirtied a bit to more closely resemble what would be expected from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with).
