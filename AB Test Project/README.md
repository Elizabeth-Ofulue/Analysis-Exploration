A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is used to test changes on a web page by running an experiment where a control group sees the old version, while the experiment group sees the new version. A metric is then chosen to measure the level of engagement from users in each group. These results are then used to judge whether one version is more effective than the other.

This project involves working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
The objective is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
