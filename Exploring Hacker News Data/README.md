#  HACKER NEWS PROJECT

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. 

It is an extremely popular site in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. 

Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question or `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

As a data analyst specifically analysing posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`, the aim of this project is to:

* Determine if `Ask HN` posts or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average.
* Determine if posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average.
