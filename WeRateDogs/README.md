## Overview

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, data will be gathered from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats to assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.

The dataset to be wrangled, analyzed and visualized is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account with over 9 million followers who rate people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

The objective of this project is to;
* Successfully wrangle, clean and write WeRateDogs Twitter data via the Twitter API to a csv file.
* Combine data from different file formats (csv, txt and tsv)
* Analyze and visualize dog ratings based on the data collected.
