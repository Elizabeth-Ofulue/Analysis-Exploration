# APPLE & GOOGLE PLAYSTORE PROJECT
For a company that builds Android and iOS mobile applications that are available, free to download and install on Apple and Google Play Store, the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads.

This means that revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the applications i.e the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better.

Working as a Data Analyst the goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand the type of apps likely to attract more users.
